# Introduction

BAP - Baseball Analytics Platform

An analytics program and platform for web-based consumption of Major League Baseball
player statistics. BAP looks to go a bit deeper in the numbers behind the best players
in the world and provide insight into why they may be performing the way they are.
Baseball is a deep and rich sport where the underlying metrics tell a unique story
of who a player is, what they're capable of, and whether they are achieving their
goals. While the most commonly known stats like ERA, Batting Average, and Slugging
Percentage give a nice cursory look that can be understood by laymen, there is
a much more complex story of how they achieved those results. BAP hopes to give
a glimpse into that rich world with a simple, intuitive user interface.

This is meant for my own personal use, but with time, may be extended to other
developers and enthusiasts.
